    <p> MYTH: </p>
    <p> The pit bull terrier is the breed most likely to bite. </p>

    <p> TRUTH: </p>
    
    <p>
     NO! According to the American Temperament Test Society, in 2012, 86.8% of American Pit Bull Terriers passed society tests that measure stability, aggressiveness, friendliness, and protectiveness. 85.2% of golden retrievers and 80.1% of collies passed these tests.

     It's clear that even Shetland Sheepdog breed has lower percentage in passing the test.
