 <h1>Camden Town</h1>
 
 <p>
  Camden Town, often shortened to Camden (also the name for the borough it is in), is a district of northwest London,
  England, 2.5 miles (4.1 km) north of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charing_Cross">Charing Cross</a>.
 </p>

 <p>
  Historically in Middlesex, it is the administrative centre of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Camden">London Borough of Camden</a>, and identified in the
  London Plan as one of 34 major centres in Greater London.
 </p>

 <p>
  Laid out as a residential district from 1791 and originally part of the manor of Kentish Town and the parish of St
  Pancras, Camden Town became an important location during the early development of the railways, which reinforced its
  position on the London canal network. The area's industrial economic base has been replaced by service industries such
  as retail, tourism and entertainment. The area now hosts street markets and music venues that are strongly associated
  with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_culture">alternative culture</a>.
