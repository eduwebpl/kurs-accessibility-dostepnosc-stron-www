 <h1> Spanish Articles 🇪🇸 </h1>

 <p>
  As in English, articles in Spanish are either definido (definite), or indefinido (indefinite).
 </p>

 <p>
  We use definite articles in Spanish the same way as we do in English: to refer to a noun as something that is
  specifically known to the speaker and his or her audience. For example:
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  Disculpa, Fernando, ¿me pasas la sal, por favor?
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  Excuse me, Fernando. Could you pass me the salt, please?
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  Because both the speaker and Fernando already know which container of salt is being referred to, the speaker uses the
  definite article. Indefinite articles are used in the opposite way: to refer to a noun that is not specifically known
  to the speaker and his or her audience.
 </p>

 <blockquote>
  Disculpa, Fernando, ¿me pasas una manzana, por favor?
 </blockquote>
 <blockquote>
  Excuse me, Fernando. Could you pass me an apple, please?
 </blockquote>

 <p>
  In the example above, it does not matter to the speaker which apple Fernando passes to him or her. It could be any
  apple within reach, as long as it is an apple.
