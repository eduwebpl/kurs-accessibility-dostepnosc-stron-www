 <h1> Almost there! </h1>
 
 <p>
  Last night something odd happened in the old city of code. Someone attempted a assasination on accessibility of their site!
 </p>

 <p>
  "Who could do such a thing?! ðŸ˜±" - you might ask.
 </p>
 
 <p>
  "Was that a gardener? ðŸ¤”"
 </p>
 
 <p>
  In order to discover the mystery, you'll have to show your courage...
 </p>

 <p class="hidden-secret visually-hidden">
  It's someone who didn't understand the case!
