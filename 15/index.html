  <p>In general, responses are very similar between respondents with and without disabilities. Any notable differences
   are detailed below to help us determine differences in practices or perceptions between the disability and the
   developer communities.</p>

  <p>We neglected to ask about usage of Braille in combination with visual or audio outputs. Many respondents
   indicating using a combination of Braille and visual and/or audio output.</p>

  <p>Nearly 25% of respondents rely at least partially on the visual components when using a screen reader. 79.5% of
   those with disabilities rely exclusively on audio, compared to only 7.4% of those without disabilities (primarily
   testers). This is not entirely unexpected, but does indicate significant differences in usage between those with
   disabilities and those without disabilities.</p>

  <p>Only 0.6% of those with disabilities rely exclusively on the visual outputâ€”many of these reported having cognitive
   or learning disabilities.</p>
